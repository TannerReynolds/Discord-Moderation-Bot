# Overview of types of values:
# String: Strings are encased in ''. Any text or snowflake (Discord ID) is a string and needs to be encased in '' or "".
# Number: Numbers are not enclosed in ''. They are just numbers and are not interpreted by the bot the same way that strings are.
# Array: Array is just a list of other types. Could be numbers, strings, or objects. each item is separated by a comma. Example: [ 'first ID', 'second ID' ]
# Object: Objects are, in this case, structures with a key and value pair. Key is the first item, value is the second item. There can also be arrays of objects.
# Boolean: Booleans are just true or false. Do NOT encase them with '' or "". They are meant to just be true or false by themselves.
